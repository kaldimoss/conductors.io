            This is a growing page that discusses, invites and develops the idea of Operators and Conductors. 
            <br> <br>

            Operators and COnductors is an attempt to bring together what has influenced me and shaped the sound I make, and the sound I respond to- and hence it is a personal work. It is a moment of reflection. Alongside, I want to look at some of ideas in this field that interest me- like the evolution of noise music, collaboration in noise music, hyperinstrumetns, spatial score writing among others.
            <br><br>
            This work is part of <a href="https://dreamy-place.com/"> 'Dreamy Place' </a>, where Beth Troakes, who runs an independednt and experimental gallery Lock In in Brighton, and I, Kaldi Moss, engage over 5 days as the Operator and Conductor respectivly.  <br> <br>
		  
		  
		  The concept of a handshake in networking is a common idea. A ping is sent, and if a response is recieved, a handshake has happened. A radio broadcast is different. There are no 'handshakes' or 'views'. As an artist and performer, I am interested in this idea of 'presence' or atleast an 'unknown presence'. It is a difficult thing for me to make something without a 'handshake'. This tells me something about myself I may not be the most willing to accept. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to explore methods of transmission, handshakes and livestreaming, realtime collaboration for sound and listening. 
            <br><br>
            This is an experiment to test the boundaries of oneself, of transmission, of internet speeds, software and hardware. 
            <br><br>
            
            I will be premiereing sounds that have never been heard before, a live concert, 
            anding in a cinematic composition bringing together artists from Chennai, Bangalore and Munich, Germany in an electronic, acoustic journey.

        1. There is an instrument at the gallery connected to the local speakers and over the netwoek. 
        2. There is an LED ticker board showing what is being streamed/ cast into the space. 
        3. One or two projectors and two, three, four or more speakers are setup in the space to best produce an immersive enviornments.
