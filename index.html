        This is a growing page that develops and discusses the idea of Operators and Conductors. This is part of the festival <a href="https://dreamy-place.com/operators/">Dreamy Place</a>
        <br><br>
        In O&C I listen and respond to my own archive of compositions created during jam sessions and performances which cut across collaboration, spatial sound, networking and software.<br>
        During the 5 day livestream from my studio in Goa, India + an undisclosed jam location and through my research in this archive, I would like to explore ideas of score writing for noise, interspecies communication, laptop orchestras, binaural and spatial sound. 
        <br><br>
        This experiment is to test the boundaries of transmission (of internet speeds, software and hardware) across two costal towns Brighton, UK and Goa, India while conducting an improvisation. You are invited to join the youtube livestreams to see Operators and Conductors in action. 
            <br>

		    20th October was a call for musicians globally to go on a strike. Radioalhara wrote ' We call on all musicians to cancel their gigs and concerts tomorrow and in the coming days to confront the violence of silence in Palestine. ' The planned gig was cancelled, the operator Beth and me decided to put up a paper noting the strike outside the gallery in Brighton. The gallery is in a jewish areas and tensions were palpable.   <br>
            Day three will be a live coding session hosted by <a href="https://khoparzi.com/"> Abhinay Khoparazi </a> on <a href="https://estuary.mcmaster.ca/"> Estuary</a>.

            Biswam Dwivedy's incredible sense of poetry; Cole Swensen's book And And And  ( which is dedicated to Biswamit ); Olivia Jack's explorations with WebRTC(that i recently descovered); Yashas Shetty for expanding my view of  practice and consistently inviting incredible artists from around the world to the ISRO;
