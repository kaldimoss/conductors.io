            This is a growing page that discusses, invites and develops the idea of OnC. 
            <br> <br>

            Operators and COnductors is my attempt to bring toghether for myself - the various developments in the field of live music/ sound collaboration, hyperinstrumetns across huge physical distances. 
            <br><br>
            When the idea of 'Transmission' was given as a prompt to me by <a href="https://dreamy-place.com/"> 'Dreamy Place' </a> , i took the opportunity to dig a little deeper into this. The concept of a handshake in networking is a common idea. A ping is sent, and if a response is recieved, a handshake has happened. A radio broadcast is different. There are no 'handshakes' or 'views'. As an artist and performer, I am interested in this idea of 'presence' or atleast an 'unknown presence'. It is a difficult thing for me to make something without a 'handshake'. This tells me something about myself I may not be the most willing to accept. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to explore methods of transmission, handshakes and livestreaming, realtime collaboration for sound and listening. 
            <br><br>
            This is an experiment to test the boundaries of oneself, of transmission, of internet speeds, software and hardware. 
            <br><br>
            
            I will be premiereing sounds that have never been heard before, a live concert, 
            anding in a cinematic composition bringing together artists from Chennai, Bangalore and Munich, Germany in an electronic, acoustic journey.

        1. There is an instrument at the gallery connected to the local speakers and over the netwoek. 
        2. There is an LED ticker board showing what is being streamed/ cast into the space. 
        3. One or two projectors and two, three, four or more speakers are setup in the space to best produce an immersive enviornments.
