        This is a growing page that develops and discusses the idea of Operators and Conductors. This is part of the festival <a href="https://dreamy-place.com/operators/">Dreamy Place</a>
        <br><br>
        In O&C I listen and respond to my own archive of compositions created during jam sessions and performances which cut across collaboration, spatial sound, networking and software.<br>
        During the 5 day livestream from my studio in Goa, India + an undisclosed jam location and through my research in this archive, I would like to explore ideas of score writing for noise, interspecies communication, laptop orchestras, binaural and spatial sound. 
        <br><br>
        This experiment is to test the boundaries of transmission (of internet speeds, software and hardware) across two costal towns Brighton, UK and Goa, India while conducting an improvisation. You are invited to join the youtube livestreams to see Operators and Conductors in action. 
            <br>
        <a href="https://t.me/+5usUcMIn93s2OTJl">This telegram channel</a> is an invitation to interact and augment the stream. You can send links, videos, sounds, text, and images to the telegram channel along with possible instructions or as open to interpretation by me (the conductor).

            Walking out of intense noise sessions, looking at the cold moon, the quiet street, silence of 4 individuals after a chaotic hour.  Shining, lovely, and hopeful awake moments.<br>Few and far in-between.
            My current moment is in need for elevation. <br>
            And And And has been elevating in ways that only very precise suspension can do. <br>
