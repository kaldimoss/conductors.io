This is a growing page that develops and discusses the idea of Operators and Conductors. 
            <br> <br>
            OnC is my attempt to bring together and investigate ideas that have shaped me in my journey across composition, collaboration and software. I will be running livestreams for 5 days from my studio in Goa + an undisclosed jam location. 
            <br> <br>
            Day1 : Solo Act   <br>
            Day2 :  <br>
            Day3 :  <br>
            Day4 :  <br>
            Day5 : Cinematic composition bringing together artists from Chennai, Bangalore and Munich, Germany in an electronic, acoustic journey.  <br>
            <br>
            You are invited to join the youtube livestreams to see Operators and Conductors in action. The telegram channel is an invitation to interact and augment the stream. You can send links, videos, sounds, text, and images to the telegram channel along with possible instructions or as open to interpretation by me (the conductor)
            
            Live links for which will be updated on this website and on the telegram channel.

            I will be <s>looking at</s> listening to my own archive, and the ideas of interspecies communication, laptop orchestras, binaural audio, composition for spatial sound, improvisation, hyperinstrumetns, score writing for noise, algoraves and allied culture.

            Walking out of intense noise sessions, looking at the cold moon, the quiet street, silence of 4 individuals after a chaotic hour.  Shining, lovely, and hopeful awake moments.<br>Few and far in-between.
            My current moment is in need for elevation. <br>
            And And And has been elevating in ways that only very precise suspension can do. <br>
            Text inside text inside text is an ancient hypertext technique. <br>
            Hydra is an ancient aqatic being.<br>
            I have invited another ancient guest. <br>
            Once all the crispy minds got together to make a jam that was sweet. <br>
